<h3>What is BotSense? </h3>
    <p>BotSense is a project of the Software Engineering Capstone class, Spring 
        2021 at Kennesaw State University. BotSense is a machine learning 
        algorithm trained to calculate a score indicate likely human 
        accounts. High scores indicate likely bot accounts. BotSense compares 
        an account to other various labeled examples. The application is used 
        by various machine learning models to compute the bot scores.

        <h3>What is a Twitter bot? </h3> 
        Given this wide range of behaviors, there is no universally 
        agreed-upon definition of bot. We define a social bot as a social 
        media account controlled at least in part through software. 
        Deceptive bots take on inauthentic personas and are controlled 
        by unknown entities. Social media APIs provide methods to 
        execute actions programmatically. 

        <h3>What does the score mean?</h3>
        <p>The "score" shown next to the user name is based on a comparison
            of many models trained on different kinds of bots and on user 
            accounts. A higher score means more bot-like activity. Bot 
            scores are displayed on a "0 to 5" scale. Score zero means 
            most human-like and score 5 means the most bot-like account. 
            A middle score is a signal that our classifier is uncertain 
            about the classification.
                </p>

            <h3>Why do I have to login to Twitter?</h3>
            <p>When a BotSense user check a Twitter user's bot score, 
                this service uses Twitter's REST API in order to obtain 
            public data about that account. And after bot-score analysis, 
            application user will receive the result. In order to use 
            Twitter's API, the user must have a Twitter account and be 
            logged in. The application user also needs permission to 
            make API request to fetch user profiles and activity from accounts.      </p>
